This repo contains material for Assignment 1 of the Genome Analysis course at Northeastern University. You'll learn to navigate your own file system and that of the high-performance computing cluster via the command line, and to perform basic manipulations of files containing sequences and related information. The assignment consists of the three UNIX tutorials: 1_UNIX.md, 2_UNIX.md, and 3_UNIX.md. Other material is supplementary.

Submit your work in your student directory on Explorer. Since you performed 1_UNIX.md locally, you'll need to transfer the text file of your work to your Explorer directory. Do this through [Open On Demand](https://ood.explorer.northeastern.edu/). In the Files menu choose Home Directory to display the contents of the directory. You can change the directory to your student directory to see its contents. Then use the Upload button to upload a file from your computer to whichever directory you have chosen.

To earn full credit:
+ All files from assignment are in your student directory by due date
+ Files are well named and well organized
+ README file describes contents and any other information useful to the "user"
+ Assignments are user-friendly: hash-commented and extraneous output deleted
+ Assignments are complete


Upon successful completion of this module, you'll be able to add to the skills section of your resum√©: "Basic UNIX/Linux command-line proficiency"!
